# Enemy Debug
Allows you to debug enemies in-game through the use of a custom gizmo system
Some gizmos shown are the result of existing gizmo draw calls that the game uses, while others are custom to help with understanding the underlying mechanics of enemies. Custom gizmos are uniquely colored to help make the system easier to understand

## Compatibility
This mod should be compatible with most mods, as it modifies very little of the game's code, but breakages may happen
